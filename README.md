# Hotel_booking_analysis_python_project
Analyze hotel booking data to get insights into the sales, profits and cancellations using python libraries

After loading dataset, we first performed EDA to understand and clean the data. We then used various plots to visualize the data and gain meaningful insights from it.
These visualizations were further used to come up with effective strategies and marketing techniques to reduce cancellations and increase the number of room bookings there by improving overall revenue collection.
